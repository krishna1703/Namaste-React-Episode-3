# Babel

# Babel is "SUPER HERO 🦸"

# Babel is a Javascript Compiler

- Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
- Source code transformations (codemods)

# Flow of jsx
 
 # JSX is "HERO 🕺"

- jsx => React.CreateElement => React Element (js object) => Html Element(Reander)
- jsx looks like a hot html but not html
- inside jsx we can write Javascript using {}
- inside jsx we can write CSS using {{}}
